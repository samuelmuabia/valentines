    <h1>The History of Valentine's Day</h1>
    <p>Valentine's Day, also known as Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine, is a holiday celebrated on February 14th. The history of Valentine's Day dates back to ancient Rome, where it was originally a pagan festival called Lupercalia.</p>
    <p>In the 5th century, Pope Gelasius declared February 14th as Saint Valentine's Day to honor Saint Valentine, a Catholic priest who was martyred for performing marriages for Christian couples during a time when the Roman Empire banned such unions. Over time, the holiday evolved into a celebration of love and affection between partners.</p>
